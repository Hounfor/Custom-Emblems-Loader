A small mod for loading your own emblems into BattleTech.

How to use:
1) Download and extract CustomEmblemsLoader.zip somewhere.
2) Place the unzipped CustomEmblemsLoader folder in the BattleTech/Mods directory.
3) Go to the BattleTech/Mods/CustomEmblemsLoader/emblems directory. There's a file called Tiger.dds, this is the emblem for your unit, used as a template. You can place any emblem in this folder and it will appear in the game.

Requirements for logos for correct display:
1) The image size must be 256x256.
2) The image format must be DDS.
3) The image must be turned upside down.
4) When saving an image in DDS format, it's recommended to use the following settings:

– Compression: BC3/DXT5

– All visible layers

– Generate mipmaps
